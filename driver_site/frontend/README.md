# Frontend Application

This is the frontend part of the fullstack application built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-fullstack-app/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   Start the development server with:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, use the following command:
